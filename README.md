# OculusVRHands

An Unity implementation of Oculus VR hand models working with new input system and the Unity XR Interation Toolkit

Most of the information about how to do this comes from this medium article:

https://medium.com/datastuffplus/using-oculus-integration-hand-animations-with-unity-xr-kit-e707b6acb0a2

It misses how to set up the input actions to get it to work though.   See the XRI Default Input Actions.inputactions file in this folder Assets\Samples\XR Interaction Toolkit\2.0.4\Starter Assets to see how its done.

The scriopt to actual animate the hands came from here originally:

I modified to use InputActionProperties.

Obviously the hand models themselves come from Oculus.
